# Malefiz bot battle!

The project is a thrown together game hacked on top of the demo in the [@prisma/text-editors repo](https://github.com/prisma/text-editors) to quickly get a nice typescript editor. The game-relevant code lives in the demo folder. Submitting bots to be added in the drop downs (and future tournaments if any) is backed via google sheets & forms.
